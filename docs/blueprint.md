## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light sage (#E0E5D8), a very pale tint of green, for a calm, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Lime green (#A4BC92), analogous to the primary but lighter, to highlight key actions.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a clean and readable interface.
- Use simple line icons to represent ingredients and cooking actions.
- Keep a clean and intuitive layout that focuses on ease of use and quick access to recipes.
- Use subtle animations when transitioning between recipe suggestions and displaying recipe details.
